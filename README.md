## Features
1. **Word Bank**: This program contains a `.csv` file that contains 182 bombastic words, 
making this hangman incredibly hard!
2. **ASCII art**: When you get it wrong, a drawing of the hangman's current situation will be printed out.
3. **Answer the full word**: When you've realized what the quiz word is, you can type the word out!
4. **lives count**: You will only have 6 lives for each round.
5. **Free and unlimited**: This game is free, and you can play as much as you want!

## Usage
Pretty short and self-explanatory. Handles invalid inputs / already chosen letter. The program will only
end if you don't want to play anymore at the end of a round.
